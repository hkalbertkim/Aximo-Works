# AXIMO WORKS — LEADCAPTURE_HVAC_SKILL_v1.0

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the first concrete Skill implementation built on the Aximo Skill Factory architecture.

LeadCapture_HVAC_Skill_v1.0 is:

An external-facing AI employee that:

- Engages website visitors
- Answers HVAC-related questions
- Captures service requests
- Dispatches leads to business owners

This Skill serves as the first real validation of the Skill Factory model.

# 2. Skill Identity

- skill_id: leadcapture_hvac
- version: v1.0
- category: lead
- supported_channels: [web]
- supported_actions: [send_email, store_lead, notify_operator]
- default_risk_level: R2
- default_approval_mode: CONDITIONAL

---

# 3. Business Problem Addressed

HVAC companies frequently lose leads after business hours.

Common issues:

- No immediate response
- Missed emergency calls
- Manual email follow-up delays

This Skill reduces lost leads by capturing intent and contact details automatically.

# 5. Context Sources

Configuration may include:

- Website URLs (up to N pages)
- Service list
- Service area ZIP codes
- Pricing guidance (optional)
- Emergency rules

Context is rebuilt per execution.

---

# 6. Skill Logic

## 6.1 Intent Categories

- Emergency repair
- Installation inquiry
- Pricing question
- General info

## 6.2 Lead Capture Trigger

If intent matches service-related category:

The Skill must request:

- Name
- Phone number
- ZIP code
- Service type

---

# 7. Action Model

## 7.1 Primary Actions

- send_email (to HVAC owner)
- store_lead (Google Sheet or equivalent)

## 7.2 Emergency Branch

If emergency detected:

- Include "Call Now" instruction
- Mark event with high priority tag

---

# 8. Risk & Approval Model

Default risk: R2 (external communication)

Policy:

- send_email: AUTO unless custom approval configured
- store_lead: AUTO
- bulk broadcast (future): REQUIRED

Approval flow is governed by CONTROL_PLANE_SPEC_v1.

---

# 9. Event Emission Requirements

Minimum events per execution:

- execution_triggered
- execution_processing
- action_prepared
- action_dispatched
- execution_completed

If failure:

- execution_failed
- action_failed (if applicable)

---

# 10. Deployment Requirements

Deployment must include:

- customer_id
- deployment_id
- skill_version (v1.0)
- configuration
- web_channel_binding

Configuration must be validated before activation.

---

# 11. Metrics Hooks (Preview)

Events generated by this Skill will allow measurement of:

- Total conversations
- Leads captured
- Emergency leads
- Failure rate
- Response latency

Metrics specification defined separately in METRICS_MODEL_v1.0.

---

# 12. Known Limitations (v1.0)

- Single-language assumption
- No CRM native integration
- No SMS dispatch
- No multi-location routing

These are roadmap items for future versions.

---

# 13. Validation Objective

This Skill is used to validate:

- Skill Lifecycle correctness
- Deployment isolation
- Event Model completeness
- Runtime Contract compatibility
- DFY onboarding process

If this Skill operates cleanly across multiple HVAC customers,
the Skill Factory architecture is validated.

---

# 14. Status

Version: v1.0
Scope: First Production Skill Implementation

This is the reference Skill for validating the Aximo platform model.
