# AXIMO EOD Report — 2026-02-22

Repo: /Users/albertkim/02_PROJECTS/03_aximo
Git HEAD: 535136a

## Summary
- Implemented Pressure2.0 (owner/priority/weight) end-to-end and verified scaling.
- Completed Approval Gate (approve/reject endpoints + Kanban UI).
- Implemented Telegram webhook approvals plumbing.
- Fixed Telegram sendMessage 401 by unifying sender.

## Completed
- Pressure2.0: owner/priority/weight persisted + UI pressure multiplier applied.
- Kanban: Approve/Reject shown for pending_approval; metadata display.
- Backend: approve/reject endpoints + approval metadata columns.
- Telegram: webhook endpoint + (pending) inline approvals; sender 401 fix committed.

## Next
- Validate Telegram inline Approve/Reject end-to-end (button → webhook → approve/reject → Kanban update).
- Harden execution rules (approved-only run enforcement) if needed.
